    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 large baking potatoes (Idaho or russet)</li>
      <li>12 slices thick-cut applewood smoked bacon</li>
      <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>6 cups 2 percent low-fat milk, heated</li>
      <li>5 ounces sharp Cheddar, grated</li>
      <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>4 ounces sour cream</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh chives</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
      <li>
        Place the potatoes on a roasting tray and bake for 45 minutes. When
        done, the tip of a paring knife should go through the potatoes easily.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slice the bacon into lardons (thin strips) and cook in a large,
        heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat until crisp. Remove the bacon from
        the pot with a slotted spoon and set aside, leaving the drippings in the
        pot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the flour to the drippings in the pot and stir to combine. Cook,
        without adding color, until the flour and fat has combined, about 1
        minute. Pour in the milk while you whisk to incorporate. Cook over
        medium heat until bubbly and thickened, stirring frequently, about 15
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scoop out the potato pulp from the skins and add to the milk mixture.
        Mash with the back of a wooden spoon leaving it a little bit chunky.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the cooked bacon (leaving a little out for garnishing the soup), 1
        cup of the cheese, and season well with salt and pepper. Stir until the
        cheese has melted. Remove from the heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ladle the soup into bowls, drizzle with sour cream (from a squeeze
        bottle), sprinkle with remaining bacon bits, grated cheese and chives.
      </li>
    </ol>
