    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Saute chicken pieces in the oil until no longer pink. Remove and keep
      warm. In the same skillet, saute the onion, green pepper and celery in the
      remaining oil until tender. Stir in the tomatoes, broth, tomato paste and
      seasonings. Bring to a boil, reduce heat; cover and simmer for 5 minutes.
      Return chicken to the pan; heat through. Serve with rice. Makes about 8
      servings. Enjoy!

      Note: We like this dish served over the rice the first night. If I have
      any left over I put it in a baking dish, mix the rice with the chicken and
      sauce, sprinkle with shredded cheese and put in the oven until warm and
      the cheese is melted the next night. Serve with garlic bread and a salad
      for a meal.
